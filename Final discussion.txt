PRCS251A Demo

This is our take on the specification given for PRCS251A.

We have decided to go with the brand "PizzaHeaven" with the Italian flag colours as base colours throughout.
We did this because our client (Mark) didn't have any branding requirements for us.

1.  WEBSITE:	Show current menu
2.  MANAGER: 	Add pizza to the menu
		Add image for the pizza
3.  WEBSITE:	Show off new menu item
		Register
		Place order
		Show off PayPal
4.  MANAGER:	Add new staff member
5.     CHEF:	Progress new order
6. DELIVERY:	Log in
		Claim order
		Follow map
		Phone customer (make sure Craig's number input)
		Delivery pizza
7.  WEBSITE:	Highlight order has left status page

Hardest parts of the project:
Web		- CSS
		- Basket re-design

Android		- Encryption (couldn't use library)
		- Expandable list view
		- Threadding creates a different way of thinking about coding

Security	- No security elements are taught to Computer Science and so we had to research our own after the 2 hour session

Desktop		- Live usability demo absolutely slated UI design and we had to develope a new view from scratch
